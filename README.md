===============================

#### Run Arcade Game
To run the game, simply download the P3 -Arcade Game folder and open the index.html file in a browser that supports HTML5 canvas.
Alternatively you can play it [online](https://adevelopercase.github.io/arcade-game/)

#### Rules
The aim of the game is to complete 5 levels reaching the target block (the one with the star).

You have 3 lifes, each time you touch an enemy or drown in the water you lose a life.
You can jump on the floating logs to cross the water.
Random rocks make it difficult to get to the finish by limiting the movement.
If you lose all the lifes the game will be resetted.

You have 40s to complete each level.
If the time expires the level changes and you don't get any star for the previous level.

When you complete a level you get 1000 points plus a bonus proportional to the remaining time.
You can also get a higher score by collecting gems:

- green gem : 100 points
- orange gem: 200 points
- blue gem  : 400 points

The more a gem is precious the faster it disappears.

If you are playing with another player, the winner is the first to complete five levels or the last to survive.
